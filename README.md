# SwiftKeys - Typing Test App

SwiftKeys is a modern, lightweight typing test application built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Designed to help users practice and improve their typing speed and accuracy, it offers a unique experience with a fully filled textarea, infinite paragraph generation, and a no-scroll, no-slide interface.

## Features
- **Fully Filled Textarea**: Starts with a fixed-height textarea packed with paragraphs, ensuring a seamless typing experience.
- **Infinite Paragraphs**: Dynamically replaces completed text with new paragraphs, keeping the content flowing without ever scrolling or sliding.
- **Real-Time Stats**: Tracks words per minute (WPM), accuracy, and progress as you type.
- **Customizable Options**: Choose test duration (30s, 60s, 90s, 120s) and toggle special characters for varied practice.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, compact UI that fits within the viewport, optimized for both light and dark themes.
